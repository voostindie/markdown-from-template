# Here's a single template example. Just copy-paste to
# templates.yaml and adapt to your liking.
#
# The values for the directory, filename and contents are
# all Liquid templates. You can use any variable you want.
# When running the tool it will prompt you for values for all
# variables it needs.
#
# The 'day', 'month' and 'year' variables, if used, are
# automatically set to today's date as default values.
#
# For other variables you can optionally define your own defaults,
# as shown in the example below
template:
  defaults:
    title: 'Default Title'
  directory: '~/Notes'
  filename: '{{title}}.md'
  contents: |
    # {{title}}

    ## Dates

    - {{day}}-{{month}}-{{year}}

    #Tag
